## Serial Debugging with printf()
Ever been stuck in an endless loop of debugging? No JTAG? No fancy debugger? Just you, your firmware, and a blinking LED?

Enter printf().

A simple printf("Value: %d\n", data); can be the difference between guessing and actually knowing what's happening inside your microcontroller.

🔹 Print variable values in real time
🔹 Trace execution flow like a pro
🔹 Debug even when everything else fails

It’s not just for printf(“Hello, World!”) anymore!

💡 Pro tip: Use UART redirection to send printf() outputs to a serial terminal—saves hours of debugging nightmares.
