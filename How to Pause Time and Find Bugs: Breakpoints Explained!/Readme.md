##  Pause Time, Catch Bugs: Breakpoints 101  
Debugging firmware and embedded systems can be tricky, but breakpoints make it easier! This guide explains how to use breakpoints to pause execution, inspect variables, and troubleshoot code effectively.  

## What are Breakpoints?
Breakpoints are debugging tools that allow developers to pause program execution at a specific line of code. This helps in:
1.Observing Variable Values: Monitor how variables change in real-time.
2.Checking Control Flow: Ensure the code executes as expected.
3.Identifying Bugs: Find unexpected behavior without print statements.
