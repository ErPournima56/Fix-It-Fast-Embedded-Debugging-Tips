## How I Debug Embedded Firmware with Just a Serial Terminal
When working with embedded systems, a serial terminal can be a powerful debugging tool‚Äîno need for expensive debuggers or complex setups. In this guide, I‚Äôll share how I debug firmware using HyperTerminal.

## üîß Tools Used
1. MCU with UART interface
2. UART-to-USB converter IC
3. PC with HyperTerminal installed

## üõ†Ô∏è Setup
1. Write and Flash Debugging Firmware
   - Add printf statements to your firmware to print debug messages. ( refer main.c )
   - Compile and flash the code to your MCU.
     
2. Connect the Hardware
   - Connect the RX & TX pins of MCU to TX & RX pins of a UART-to-USB converter IC
   - Connect to GND of the converter module
   - Connect a wire from the UART-to-USB converter module to the PC‚Äôs USB port
     
3. Configure Hyperterminal
   - Open Hyperterminal
   - Select Call to set up a new connection and specify a filename to save the output
   - Select the correct COM PORT ( check it from Device Manager )

## ‚úÖ Why Use a Serial Terminal for Debugging?
   ‚úî Works in Any MCU with UART
   ‚úî No Extra Cost (No JTAG/SWD needed)
   ‚úî Quick Field Debugging
   ‚úî Lightweight & Effective

##  Can We Use I2C or SPI Instead of UART?
Yes, you can use I2C or SPI with an appropriate I2C-to-USB or SPI-to-USB converter IC. However, UART is preferred for debugging because:
   - Direct PC Communication ‚Äì UART uses TTL logic levels (3.3V/5V), making it directly compatible with USB-to-serial converters. I2C/SPI require extra hardware
   - Easier Readability ‚Äì UART sends human-readable ASCII text, while I2C/SPI work with binary data, needing extra parsing
   - Availability ‚Äì USB-to-UART converters are widely used, whereas I2C/SPI-to-USB converters are less common.

That said, if your MCU lacks UART or you need to debug low-level peripheral communication, I2C/SPI could be an option with the right converter.

Using just a simple UART connection, you can quickly diagnose firmware behavior without external debuggers. If you have questions or need help setting up, drop a comment!
