# 🔥 Soldering Issues  

## Problem  
Poor soldering can cause **cold joints, shorts, or missing connections**, leading to non-working circuits.  

## Solution  
🔍 Inspect for:  
- **Cold joints** (dull or uneven solder)  
- **Bridged solder joints** (unwanted connections between joints)  
- **Missing solder on critical pads**  
- Weak solder joints (solder not fully bonding to the pad or pin)

🔍 Fix by:  
- Reflowing solder with a hot air gun or soldering iron  
- Using flux to ensure proper flow
- Removing excess solder with a solder wick or desoldering pump

💡 **Pro Tip:** If unsure, test **continuity and resistance** across suspicious points!  

⚠️ Warning: Never short any links or PTH points without referring to the schematic, as this can cause unintended circuit failures.
