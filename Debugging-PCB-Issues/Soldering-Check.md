# 🔥 Soldering Issues  

## Problem  
Poor soldering can cause **cold joints, shorts, or missing connections**, leading to non-working circuits.  

## Solution  
🔹 Inspect for:  
✔️ **Cold joints** (dull or uneven solder)  
✔️ **Bridged solder joints** (unwanted connections between joints)  
✔️ **Missing solder on critical pads**  
✔️ Weak solder joints (solder not fully bonding to the pad or pin)

🔹 Fix by:  
- Reflowing solder with a hot air gun or soldering iron  
- Using flux to ensure proper flow
- Removing excess solder with a solder wick or desoldering pump

💡 **Pro Tip:** If unsure, test **continuity and resistance** across suspicious points!
