🛠️ Debugging PCB Issues: Checking Continuity & Power Supply

Problem:
You’ve designed and placed your PCB, but during testing, it’s not giving expected results. The circuit isn’t working as intended—no output, unstable behavior, or some components seem inactive.

Quick Checks to Fix It Fast:

✅ Step 1: Check Power Supply
Use a multimeter to measure voltage at critical points (VCC, GND, and key IC power pins).
Verify whether the power rails are providing expected values.


✅ Step 2: Check Continuity
Use the continuity mode on your multimeter to check if traces are properly connected.
Confirm that no broken or incomplete connections exist between important components.


✅ Step 3: Inspect Soldering & Short Circuits
Look for cold solder joints, missing connections, or accidental shorts (especially between power and ground).
Reflow solder if necessary.


✅ Step 4: Verify Component Orientation
Double-check if polarized components (diodes, electrolytic capacitors, ICs) are correctly placed.


Pro Tip:
Always test power rails first before debugging the rest of the circuit. No power = No debugging!
