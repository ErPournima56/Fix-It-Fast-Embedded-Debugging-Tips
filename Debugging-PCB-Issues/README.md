##🛠️ Debugging PCB Issues
Your PCB is assembled, but something’s off. Components aren’t responding, signals are unstable, or nothing works at all. Now what?

Before diving into complex fixes, start with the basics—power, connections, and soldering. Many PCB issues come down to:
✔️ A missing or unstable power supply
✔️ A broken connection or bad solder joint
✔️ A short circuit you didn’t notice

Follow a structured approach - observe, measure, and eliminate possible causes step by step.

Inside this folder, you’ll find practical techniques to help you diagnose and fix your PCB faster. Let’s debug smarter!
