# 🔋 Power Supply Check  

## Problem  
Your PCB is assembled, but some components **are not responding** or the circuit behaves oddly.  

## Solution  
🔹 Use a **multimeter** to measure voltage at:  
- VCC & GND  
- Power pins of key ICs and microcontrollers  
- Voltage regulators or converters  

🔍 Check for:  
- **Correct voltage levels** (e.g. 3.3V, 5V, etc.)  
- **Unstable readings**, which may indicate power noise

🔍 Also, check:
- Polarity of components – Make sure capacitors, diodes, and ICs are placed correctly.
- Resistor values – Wrong resistor values can cause incorrect voltages, especially in voltage dividers.

💡 * Tip: * If the voltage is fluctuating, check for missing decoupling capacitors near power pins!
