## #Debugging Embedded Systems Using GPIO Pins
Embedded debugging can be frustrating when you have no serial output, no debugger, and no idea what’s wrong. Luckily, GPIO pins can act as simple, reliable debugging tools to help you trace execution flow and find issues faster.

## How It Works
1. LED Debugging 💡
- Connect an LED to a spare GPIO pin.
- Toggle the pin at specific code checkpoints to check if execution reaches that point.
- Helps identify whether the issue is software-related (e.g., code not running) or hardware-related (e.g., faulty components).
  
2 Logic Analyzer/Oscilloscope Debugging 📊
- Use a GPIO pin to output debug pulses at key execution points.
- Connect a logic analyzer or oscilloscope to visualize timing and signal integrity.
- Useful for:
          *  Measuring ISR execution time ⏱️
          *  Debugging delays and event triggers
          *  Checking timing issues in real-time systems

## Why Would You Need GPIO Debugging Instead?
❌ No UART Available – Some MCUs have limited serial ports.
❌ Serial Interface Not Working – If UART itself is faulty, you can’t debug with it.
❌ Timing-Critical Debugging – Serial output takes processing time and may disrupt real-time behavior.
