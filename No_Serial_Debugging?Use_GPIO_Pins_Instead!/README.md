## No Serial Debugging? Use GPIO Instead!
When serial debugging isn't an option, GPIO pins can be a simple yet effective way to debug embedded systems. This folder contains different methods and techniques to use GPIOs for debugging hardware and firmware issues.

## ðŸ¤” Problem:
- No Serial Logs? â€“ Firmware crashes before printing logs
- Not Enough Pins? â€“ Can't dedicate multiple GPIOs for debugging
- Timing Issues? â€“ Need real-time event tracking, but serial is too slow
- Peripheral Conflicts? â€“ UART is already in use for something else

## ðŸ“‚ Whatâ€™s Inside?
- Smart GPIO Debugging Tricks â€“ How to debug with just 1-2 pins
- LED & Pulse Debugging â€“ Simple ways to visualize errors
- Using Logic Analyzers â€“ Capture and decode GPIO signals
- Code Examples â€“ Ready-to-use debugging techniques

## ðŸŽ¯ Why Use This?
- Debug when UART/SWD is unavailable.  
- Visualize program flow using LEDs.  
- Check hardware interactions without serial logs.
