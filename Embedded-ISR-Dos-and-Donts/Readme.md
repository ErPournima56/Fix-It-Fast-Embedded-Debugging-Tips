# 🛠️ ISR Best Practices for Embedded Systems

In real-time embedded systems, **Interrupt Service Routines (ISRs)** should be designed to be as short and efficient as possible. 
One common mistake developers make is **initializing variables or calling other functions inside ISRs**. 
While this might not cause syntax errors, it introduces performance issues that can affect the reliability of your system.

---

When writing Interrupt Service Routines (ISRs) in embedded systems, it's crucial to avoid doing too much work inside them. Specifically:

🚫 Don't:
* Initialize variables (especially large structs or arrays)
* Call non-reentrant or time-consuming functions
* Perform memory allocations
* Use printf() or logging functions that depend on system resources

✅ Why?
ISRs are meant to be short and fast. Doing heavy work can lead to:

* Priority inversion
* Hard-to-debug timing issues
* Increased system latency or jitter

✅ Do this instead:

* Set flags or post messages to a queue
* Handle the actual processing in the main loop or a lower-priority task/thread

💡 Real-Time Rule of Thumb:
"If it can wait, keep it out of the ISR"
